Hello, and welcome to the Deterministic Blog! I am Mehmet Kutay Bozkurt, in my junior year of high school. 
I fricking love to code and love to do what I want to do. And this blog is what I want to do in my free time. 
This blog is going to be a general blog where I post anything related to coding, software development, 
mathematics, physics, and overall things that I love. I want this blog to be a place where I put my 
thoughts and ideas, and I want you, the viewer, to learn from and read what I write.


I also love the Nord Theme (duh!) and anything related to it.

If you have anything to say to me, you can contact me through Discord and Twitter, which you can find 
the information on my [website](https://www.mkutay.dev).
